		<p>In the early ‘90s alternative music was embraced by the media and the masses, marking the start of an exciting and confusing period for artists and fans, writes Craig Schuftan. Looking back on the era, was there a revolution or did bands simply sell out?
		In the 1990s, a great deal of music which had been considered underground, punk, or just plain weird in the 1980s could suddenly be found in the mainstream; playing on commercial television, on the radio, in shopping centres and sporting arenas.
		At the start of the decade, Radio 1 and Top of the Pops in Britain rang with the sound of indie guitar bands like The Stone Roses, Primal Scream and Happy Mondays By 1994, MTV and FM radio in America had been all but taken over by scruffy regional post-punk groups like The Smashing Pumpkins, Hole, L7, Soundgarden and Nirvana.

The mid ‘90s saw the sound of British indie bands like Blur, Pulp, Elastica and Oasis established as the dominant mode of popular music in that country, thanks to the phenomenon known as Britpop. Meanwhile, in the United States, the so-called ‘alternative nation’ sent a succession of ever-stranger anti-pop acts to the top of the pop charts, including neo-punk bands like Green Day and Blink 182, and genre hybridists such as Beck, No Doubt and Nine Inch Nails.

By the decade’s end, alternative music was both triumphant and meaningless. Its stars played to massive crowds and its music was used to sell cars on television. It had integrated itself completely into the media spectacle, and could no longer reasonably claim to be offering an alternative to it.

‘Alternative, alternative. Alternative to what?’ —Billie-Joe Armstrong, 1993

At the time, this was cause for both celebration and despair—and from our current vantage point, both reactions might seem a little over-the-top. We may choose to see the alt-rock crossover as just another turn of pop culture’s eternal cycle, its artists subject to rock-and-roll’s most basic physical law—what comes up, must sell out.

Artists and scenes are small and obscure, until they are discovered and become popular. When, from the earliest days of rhythm and blues, to the Dubstep mannerisms in the pop charts today, has it been otherwise?</p>
