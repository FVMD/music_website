			<H1>The Indie/Alternative Genre: Origins</H1>
		</header>
		<p>The term Indie/Alternative describes the genre of music that emerged in the late 1970's. The term "indie" was originally used to describe indepently produced music, but evolved to cover a genre of post-punk music. This genre moved away from the gritty, serious tones of the underground rock that preceeded it, and was less glamourous than the pop music at the time. The concept of indie music as a genre didn't solidify until the late 1980's and early 1990's. During the 1990's, grunge bands such as Nirvana and Soundgarden broke out into the mainstream music scene and achieved major success. At the same time, punk-revival bands like Green Day began topping charts and both subgenres were grouped under the "alternative" title. This allowed the genre to move away from the smaller scale indie scene and combine to become the more mainstream music culture of Indie/Alternative. In the BBC documentary, <span style="font-stlye:italic;">Music for Misfits: The Story of Indie</span> the self-publication of the Spiral Scratch EP album by The buzzcocks is credited as the beginning of the indie scene.</p>

			<H1>Characteristics of the Genre</H1>
		</header>
		<p>The characteristics of the Indie/Alternative genre are described as the sound of "do it yourself" labels, due to the term originally meaning independent. This is characterized as having a balance of pop and rock, the rhythm and accessibility of pop with the authenticity and experimentation of rock. It can be classified as varying music tastes not compatible with mainstream music, despite evolving into a mainstrem genre in the modern age. It also features a higher number of female leads than the previous rock genres before it. Some bands that are mainly associated with the genre are Nirvana, Coldplay, The Killers, and Imagine Dragons.</p>
